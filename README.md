The DR & AMD Detection App is designed to make early diagnosis of Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) and Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) more accessible and convenient. Using advanced machine learning models, the app analyzes retinal images captured through a compatible camera setup.

For DR, the app provides a severity score on a scale of 0â€“4, where 4 indicates the highest risk of advanced disease. For AMD, it categorizes the disease stage based on retinal features.

This app is especially useful for individuals in remote areas or with limited access to ophthalmologists, offering quick and reliable results that can guide timely medical attention. By bringing AI-powered eye screening to a mobile platform, it aims to support early detection, improve patient outcomes, and reduce the burden on healthcare facilities.
