Diabetes is a prevalent health issue affecting one in six individuals globally, with eye diseases
being a common complication of the condition. These eye diseases, including diabetic retinopathy,
macular edema, and glaucoma, can lead to irreversible vision loss if not detected and treated in a
timely manner.
Traditionally, the detection of eye diseases has been performed by ophthalmologists through
manual inspections of the retina. However, limited availability of medical experts or potential
errors in manual inspections may lead to delayed diagnosis and treatment, further exacerbating the
impact of these diseases. To address this issue, artificial intelligence and machine learning
technologies have been leveraged to develop computer-based tools for automated detection of eye
diseases. These tools can assist healthcare professionals in early detection and provide accurate
and efficient diagnoses, potentially reducing the burden on ophthalmologists and improving the
accessibility of eye care services. Early and accurate detection of eye diseases is essential to
mitigate the risk of vision loss and improve health outcomes for individuals with diabetes.
The diabetic retinopathy project aims to develop an ML model that can diagnose diabetic
retinopathy by analyzing retinal images. The model will be trained to give a diagnostic output on
a scale of 0-4, with 4 indicating the highest chance of diabetic retinopathy. To make the diagnostic
process more accessible and convenient, an android app will be developed. Users can click retinal
photos using the camera setup provided and upload them to the app, which will then provide a
diagnostic output based on the ML model. This app can be especially helpful for individuals who
have limited access to healthcare facilities or live in remote areas.
Overall, this project has the potential to make a significant impact on the healthcare industry by
providing a more accessible and efficient diagnostic tool for diabetic retinopathy. Additionally,
the use of ML technology in healthcare can pave the way for further developments in the field,
leading to improved patient outcomes and better healthcare services.
